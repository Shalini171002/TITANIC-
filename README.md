 Titanic Classifier

![Titanic Classifier](https://your-image-url.com)

## Overview

This project implements a classifier to predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic. The classifier is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including features such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-classifier.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download the pre-trained model (if available) or train your own using the instructions in [Model Training](#model-training).

2. Run the classifier on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --passenger_info "Pclass=3, Sex=male, Age=22, SibSp=1, Parch=0, Fare=7.25, Embarked=S"
   ```

## Dataset

Describe the Titanic dataset used for training and testing the classifier. Include details such as the source, size, and format of the data.

## Data Exploration

Provide insights from the data exploration phase, such as visualizations and key statistics. This may include survival rates, distribution of passengers by class, age distribution, etc.

## Data Preprocessing

Explain the steps taken to preprocess the data before training the model. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Feature Engineering

Describe the features used for training the machine learning model. This could include creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's performance.

## Model Training

Provide details on how to train the Titanic classifier model. Include information about the chosen algorithm, hyperparameters, and any additional settings.

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/training_data.csv --model_save_path /path/to/save/model
```

## Evaluation

Explain how the model's performance is evaluated. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --test_data_path /path/to/test_data.csv
```

## Results

Share the results of the Titanic classifier, including performance metrics and any visualizations that help illustrate the model's effectiveness.
